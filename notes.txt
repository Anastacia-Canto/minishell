REDIRECTIONS

imput readirections is not working with pipes. 
The reason for that is because the readirections are being readed from pipe to pipe. 
Probably will need to get all arguments including after pipe so it will get parsed 
and only after that it will go to the pipe function

readirection '>' -> for exemple: echo hello world > output.txt hello > output2.txt hello
					result: output.txt is empty, output2.txt "hello world hello hello"
					The output.txt is created anyways even if is going to be empty.
			
			'>>' -> The same happens to this redirection but it appends instead of overwritting.

										cat: good: No such file or directory
										cat: bye: No such file or directory



PARA RESOLVER AINDA:

 - '' -> causa memory leak na join do get_path
 - | -> memory leak na check_line
 - '|' -> memory leak na check_line
 - > -> memory leak na check_line
 - '>' -> memory leak na check_line
